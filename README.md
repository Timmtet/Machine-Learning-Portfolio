# Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my Machine Learning Portfolio! This repository is a collection of projects which showcase a significant practical and theoretical understanding of various machine learning algorithms. 

## Overview

This repository is organized into folders, where each of the folders is dedicated to a specific supervised or unsupervised learning algorithm. These projects cover a wide range of machine learning techniques, with the aim of providing insights into different approaches and methodologies.

## Web Applications

All supervised learning algorithms have been deployed as web applications using Django that can be run locally. The 'Django' folder  contains the code for all the web applications which enables users to experience and experiment with the algorithm in a user-friendly environment.



Thank you for visiting my Machine Learning Portfolio!
